# Gamjectfolder

This is a simple Python app that creates a folder strutcture as well as a default empty README.txt file for a Game Project.

Its goal is to standarize the process of starting a new Game Project by providing default folders and subfolders as well.

The MAIN folder is named with the creation date in ISO format followed by the name the user picks, then the structure follows:
  YYYYMMDD-Name
  |---Name-AuxFiles
  |     |---AuxFONTS
  |     |---AuxIMAGES
  |     |---AuxMODELS
  |     |---AuxPACKAGES
  |     |---AuxSOUNDS
  |     |---AuxTRANSLATIONS
  |---Name-BackUPs
  |---Name-Builds
  |     |---Alpha
  |     |---Beta
  |     |---ReleaseCandidate
  |     |---README.txt
  |---Name-Marketing
  |     |---MktLOGOS
  |     |---MktPRESS_KIT
  |     |---MktSCREENSHOTS
  |     |---MktVIDEOS
  |---Name-PROJECT
        |---Proj-FINAL
        |---Proj-WIP
